                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>Alloys:</strong> Technically a misnomer; this is what we call alloying elements. Alloying elements such as carbon, manganese, and vanadium are added to steel to strengthen it.</li>
                    <li><strong>ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials):</strong> An organization that develops and publishes widely accepted technical standards for a variety of materials, including steel. These standards serve as essential guidelines for the manufacturing and usage of materials, ensuring quality, safety, and consistency across industries. Adherence to ASTM standards is often required to guarantee product reliability and compliance with regulatory and safety norms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burn (in the context of sample analysis):</strong> A single analysis on a sample. Named as such because after an analysis, the surface of the sample has a mark that looks like it was burned.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="c-d">C - D</h3>
                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>Caster Runout:</strong> Roller conveyor that transports formed billets from the caster down a line toward the billet yard. Billets are cooled, cut to size, weighed, counted, and marked by the runout operator.</li>
                    <li><strong>Casting Tech:</strong> Supervisor in charge of all caster operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Charge Bucket:</strong> Large buckets with a hinged "clamshell" bottom used to transport scrap materials into the Melt Shop to be dropped (or "charged") into the furnace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Standard:</strong> A Known reference material with precisely measured and certified properties, used to verify that the spectrometer is reading within specifications and providing consistent results. The check standards used in the lab include the BS1030A (standard check), 18839 (low carbon check), and Pbcheck (lead check).</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Casting:</strong> Also called strand casting, is the process where molten metal is solidified into a billet, bloom, or slab for subsequent rolling in the finishing mills. Prior to the introduction of continuous casting in the 1950s, steel was poured into stationary molds to form ingots. This process allows for efficient and consistent production of steel products with minimal interruptions. Our Melt Shop produces 160mm square billets.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSA (Canadian Standards Association):</strong> A standards organization in Canada, similar in function to ASTM in the United States.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diversions:</strong> Heats that won't pass for the intended grade can be regraded to something compatible with the chemistry. Generally, this means that the billet length and stacking area will have to be changed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drift Correction:</strong> A process that helps maintain the accuracy of a spectrometerâ€™s measurements over time. A change in how accurately the instrument reads (also known as drift) can be caused by anything from the age of the equipment to changes in the environment where the spectrometer is located (temperature, humidity etc.). A drift correction is performed by taking a number of reference samples with known values and analyzing them multiple times to recalibrate the instrument.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="e-h">E - H</h3>
                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>EAF (Electric Arc Furnace):</strong> A type of furnace used in steelmaking that relies on an electric arc to melt scrap steel and other raw materials. EAFs are known for their efficiency and flexibility, making them a key component in modern steel production.</li>
                    <li><strong>FI:</strong> Final chemistry. Determined by averaging the TN1 and TN2 samples.</li>
                    <li><strong>FR:</strong> Furnace sample.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat:</strong> A term used to refer to a single batch of steel. Heats produced in our Melt Shop are roughly 110 tons.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="l-m">L - M</h3>
                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>Ladle:</strong> A large, refractory-lined container used in the steelmaking process to transport and pour molten metal from the furnace into molds or other equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ladle Fork:</strong> A rotating arm used to move the ladle between the tapping station (under the furnace) and the stir station.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ladleman:</strong> Stirs the ladle and sends LT samples to the lab. After the ladle has finished pouring at the caster, the ladleman performs any necessary maintenance on the ladle before putting it back into service.</li>
                    <li><strong>LB:</strong> Ladle bottom sample.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures:</strong> Safety procedures that involve physically locking machinery or equipment in an off or neutral position and securing it with a tag to prevent accidental or unauthorized activation. Lockout is performed before maintenance or servicing work to ensure that the machinery cannot be started, protecting workers from hazardous energy sources and potential accidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>LT:</strong> Ladle top sample.</li>
                    <li><strong>Melter:</strong> Shift supervisor in charge of all furnace operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="o-q">O - Q</h3>
                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>OES Spectrometer:</strong> An optical emission/spark spectrometer is used to analyze the composition of materials. It works by using a spark to heat up a small amount of the material being analyzed, which causes it to emit light. This light is then separated into its component wavelengths using a prism or diffraction grating, and the intensities of the different wavelengths are measured using a detector. Each element in the material being analyzed emits light at specific wavelengths, so by analyzing the wavelengths and intensities of the light emitted, the spectrometer can identify the different elements present in the material and determine their concentrations. The spectrometers used in the lab are the ThermoFisher Scientific 4460 (primary) and 3460 (backup).</li>
                    <li><strong>OXSAS Optical Emission Analytical Software:</strong> A program used to control the spectrometers and display chemistry analysis results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Points:</strong> The term we use for a single decimal point change on an element. One point of carbon added to a heat with a .43 would make it .44; a ten point decrease from a .043 sulfur would be .033; etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>QMOS (Quad Mill Operating System):</strong> A software system used for scheduling and managing steel production.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="r-t">R - T</h3>
                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>Refractory:</strong> A heat-resistant material, often made of ceramics or minerals, used to line furnaces, ladles, and other equipment in high-temperature industrial processes like steelmaking. Refractories help withstand extreme heat and chemical reactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Residual Elements:</strong> Elements in the scrap that can't be changed in a meaningful way during the steelmaking process. The residual elements are Phosphorus (P), Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), Tin (Sn), and Nickel (Ni). Lead (Pb) and Aluminum (Al) are also considered residuals, but these can be refined out of the steel during the melting process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slag:</strong> Byproduct formed during the melting and refining of metals like iron and steel. It contains impurities, non-metallic materials, and other elements separated from molten metal. Slag is often used in construction materials and cement production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strand Tender:</strong> Monitors the ladle stream, tundish, and strands. Takes LB and TN samples to send to the lab.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tapping:</strong> Pouring the molten steel through a small opening on the underside of the furnace (called a taphole) into a ladle. The steel is generally heated to around 3100 Â°F before tapping.</li>
                    <li><strong>TN:</strong> Tundish sample.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transition Billets:</strong> Billets at the front or end of a heat that are used to isolate grades. This helps to keep incompatible grades from mixing. See SJP-0014-QCA 'Casting Dissimilar Grades'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tundish:</strong> A refractory-lined container used in continuous casting. It serves as an intermediary vessel between the ladle and the molds. The tundish helps regulate the flow of molten steel into the molds, ensuring a consistent and controlled distribution of steel to create billets.</li>
