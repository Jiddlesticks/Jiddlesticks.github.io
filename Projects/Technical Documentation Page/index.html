                <p>Safety is our top priority at Nucor. Basic knowledge of proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures, observations, and reporting policies is essential for safely performing tasks in the lab.</p>
                <p>While the chemistry lab may not be as hazardous as other areas of the mill, there are still a number of precautions that need to be taken:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Alley Traffic:</span> Exercise caution while entering and exiting the lab; forklifts and other equipment are frequently used in this area.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Hot Samples:</span> Always assume that samples (steel and slag) are hot; never touch them barehanded.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Retrieving Samples:</span> When retrieving samples in the alley, pull the bin out of the housing to prevent a dropped sample from contacting your hand.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Grinding Safety:</span> Exercise caution while grinding samples, watching out for pinch points that could catch your glove and lead to contact with the grinding surface. When possible, use the auto-grinder or milling machine, as these are hands-free devices.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Equipment Maintenance:</span> Never perform equipment maintenance without first confirming if a lockout is required.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the Melt Shop, steel production begins in the scrapyard. Crane operators load scrap into charge buckets, which are then moved into the shop. The charge crane then picks the bucket up and drops the scrap into the furnace (known as charging the furnace). It takes three charges to make a heat, and about fifty minutes to melt the scrap and get it to 3100 °F, which is the ideal

                        <span class="tooltip">Tapping a heat is pouring the steel through a small opening on the underside of the furnace (called a taphole) into a ladle.</span>
                    </span> temperature.
                Before the heat is tapped into the ladle, a sample (FR sample) is taken through the door of the furnace and sent for analysis. The Melter adds 
                    <span class="tooltip-container" data-tooltip="alloys">
                        <span class="tip-term">alloys</span><span class="tooltip">Technically a misnomer; this is what we call alloying elements. Alloying elements such as carbon, manganese, and vanadium are added to steel to strengthen it.</span></span> for the desired grade, and the process repeats.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the ladle is moved to the stir station using the ladle fork. A stir rod is dipped into the steel and begins blowing nitrogen into the ladle to agitate the steel and incorporate all of the additions from the Melter. After about five minutes of stirring, another sample (called a ladle top, or LT 1 sample) is sent for analysis. LT 1 helps verify the incorporation of alloys and assists in determining if further additions are needed. Most of the time, a second ladle top (LT 2) sample is taken to confirm alloy mixing and assess the need for additional adjustments.</p>    
                <p>The ladle, now well-stirred and at the correct temperature to cast (~2900 °F), is picked up by another crane and transported to the caster.</p>    
                <p>At the caster, the ladle is set on a

                        <span class="tooltip">The ladle turret is a rotating platform on top of the caster that allows two ladles to be set on top of the caster. This makes it possible to have one heat pouring and another staged to pour next.</span>

                        <span class="tip-term">tundish</span>
                        <span class="tooltip">A tundish is a refractory-lined container used in continuous casting. It serves as an intermediary vessel between the ladle and the molds. The tundish helps regulate the flow of molten steel into the molds, ensuring a consistent and controlled distribution of steel to create billets.</span>
                    </span> through a nozzle. The tundish acts as a funnel, draining through nozzles to create four strands that pour into molds. A sample is taken from the first half of the heat pouring (called a tundish sample, or TN 1) via one of those strands to verify that the chemistry meets grade. Another sample is taken from the second half of the heat (TN 2) to ensure the heat's homogeneity. The final chemistry (FI) for the heat is determined by averaging TN 1 and TN 2.</p>    
                <p>As the billets cool and are cut to length, they continue down a roller conveyor (called the runout), where they are weighed, counted, marked, and pushed onto the runout table. Finally, a billet crane picks up the cooled billets and stacks them in rolling order for future processing.</p>
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p>Each heat will have at least 4 samples, but the norm is 6. The order of samples, as explained above, is <span class="bold">FR&rarr;LT1&rarr;LT2</span> (if necessary) <span class="bold">&rarr;TN1&rarr;TN2.</span> When TN2 is sent down, instead of running it individually, it is averaged with TN1 to make up the final, or <span class="bold">FI</span> analysis. Occasionally, if there are issues stirring or concern that a heat won't make grade, a sample can be taken from the ladle stream as soon as it opens; this is called a ladle bottom, or <span class="bold">LB</span>. Since the sample is taken before the steel makes it to the tundish, it allows up to 10 minutes of extra time before billets begin cutting to determine if the heat needs to be diverted. When transitioning between grades, billet samples are taken from the front or end of a heat to ensure no incompatible chemistries are mixing. FR and LT samples are sent down using the pneumatic tube system in the lab; LB and TN samples are dropped down a pipe in the alley just outside of the lab.</p>
                    <p>During normal operations, we can be running samples from up to three heats at a time, so keeping track of where you are in the process with each heat is extremely important.</p>

                <p>QMOS (Quad Mill Operating System), also known as Quad, is a central tool in our daily operations in the chemistry lab. Quad Infotech's description of the software is:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"QMOS enables users to schedule the production of the steel plants in the Melt Shop and the Rolling Mill while optimizing the process and yield. The schedule, along with real time production and quality information, is disseminated to the steel mill operators and managers empowering them to take immediate and informed actions if and when necessary.</p>

                        <p>QMOS manages the entire process from receiving customer orders, creation of production schedule for each work center, as well as managing the demand for the steel. The coverage continues all the way to the production of the billets and further down to packaging and shipment of semi-finished and finished products."</p>

                <p>The program we use to control the spectrometers (4460 and 3460) is called OXSAS. Here's a description directly from ThermoFisher Scientific:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Thermo Scientific OXSAS software for OES instruments runs a variety of analyses from simple tasks to complex jobs, including the development of new analytical methods and calibrations as well as rapid high-quality routine elemental analysis. OES provides rapid analysis of carbon and low nitrogen along with all other alloying elements in iron and steel..."
                    </blockquote>
                <p>The 'Quantitative Analysis' window in OXSAS is used to analyze and display the full chemistry of a sample. The screen is divided into 29 columns, each displaying either an element's value or a calculated value. It's important to note that there are a few unnecessary calculated values on this screen, which are holdovers from grades we no longer produce. These include all of the columns beginning with a Y, T, or an E.</p>

                <p>In the 'Quantitative Analysis' window of OXSAS, each row represents a single burn of a sample. These rows can be selected or deselected based on the quality of the burn and are then averaged out in the bottom row. The average of these samples is what we save to QMOS and communicate to the crew. Ensuring the quality of each burn within an analysis is crucial, and it's equally important that the rows contributing to the average are similar to one another. This practice ensures that we report accurate numbers to the crew, and ultimately the customer.</p>
                <p>Although all of the numbers on this screen are important, the crew is only concerned with the elements that can be directly controlled by our processes. The following document lists the primary controllable elements that should be communicated to the furnace or caster on each grade. This can be used as a cheat sheet but should not be used in place of the specsheet.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The other windows within OXSAS that we frequently use are:</p>
