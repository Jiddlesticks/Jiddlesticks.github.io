                <h1>The Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie, According to Jacques Torres | Food Skills</h1>
                <iframe id="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnDSeGI0zJM?si=G6TYQTfzkfoEx4lC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Chocolate chip cookies are hard to screw up. But when a French pastry master and chocolatier gets his hands on the treat, the result is an elevated take on an all-American classic. Made with cake flour and cocoa butter-packed chocolate, Jacques Torres' infamous cookies are a perfect blend of salty and sweetâ€”crisp on the outside, and warm and gooey in the center. Inside Torres' Brooklyn factory, Food Skills gets behind-the-scenes look at Mr. Chocolate's world-famous recipe.
